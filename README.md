# ABOUT ME: 🧔🏾 #

**Name:** Olanrewaju Oyelaja  

**Hometown:** Lagos, Nigeria

**Prior IT Experience:** I am a newbie to IT but continue to find myself inspiried by the amount of things that can be learned everyday in this field.

**Career Plans:** When I complete this NPursuit/COR Cybersecurity Course I would like to find a dynamic cybersecurity role that celebrates individual
                     contirbuitions as well as team contributions as well.

**Proud Project:**  [osTicket: Prerequisites and Installation](https://github.com/rayoyelaja7/osticket-prereqs) I am proud of this projcect beacuse It was my introduction to 
                    GITHUB.  After making this repository I realized that my desire to work in IT was more than a hobby but a passion.  I dove headfirst into learning Markdown 
                    language so that I could make my repository presentable in a way that I deemed acceptable and relized that I enjoyed every bit of it. I truley can not wait to delve
                    down many IT & Cybersecurity rabbit holes!
