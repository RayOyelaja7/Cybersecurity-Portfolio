# ABOUT ME: 🧔🏾 #

**Name:** Olanrewaju Oyelaja  

**Hometown:** Lagos, Nigeria

**Prior IT Experience:** While I am new to the field of Information Technology, I am consistently inspired by its depth, dynamism, and the endless opportunities to learn and grow. My curiosity and commitment to continuous learning have driven me to explore foundational concepts in cybersecurity and IT on my own, and I’m eager to build formal knowledge through this program. I believe my enthusiasm, adaptability, and strong problem-solving mindset will help me thrive in this fast-paced field.

**Career Plans:** After completing the *NPursuit/COR Cybersecurity Course*, I plan to start a career in Healthcare IT and Cybersecurity. I’m really interested in helping protect sensitive patient information and making sure healthcare systems stay secure and reliable. With so much technology involved in healthcare now, I want to be part of the effort that keeps everything running securly behind the scenes.  I’m looking for a role where I can keep learning, grow my skills, and be part of a team that values both individual contributions and working together to solve problems.

**Proud Project:**  [osTicket: Prerequisites and Installation](https://github.com/rayoyelaja7/osticket-prereqs) I’m especially proud of this project because it marked my introduction to GitHub and really solidified my interest in IT. After creating this repository, I realized that working in tech was more than just a hobby — it’s something I’m truly passionate about. I took the time to learn Markdown so I could present my work in a clean, professional way, and I genuinely enjoyed every moment of the process. That experience showed me how much I love diving into new tools and concepts, and I can’t wait to explore even more areas within IT and cybersecurity.
